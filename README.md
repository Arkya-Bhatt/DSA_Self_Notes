# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! This collection serves as **a personal log of my learning journey** through the fundamental concepts of computer science. It contains a series of Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific DSA topic.

## ðŸŽ¯ About This Repository

This repository is a dedicated space where I document my implementations and notes on various data structures and algorithms. The primary goal is to **solidify my understanding**, **practice Python programming**, and build a personal reference guide for future review.

All implementations are written in **Python 3** and presented in **Jupyter Notebooks** to combine code, explanations, and examples in an interactive format. The notebooks were created and compiled using **Google Colab**, making them easy to open and run in the browser without any local setup.
